# Popular Movies
An Android app created during the Android Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity

This project uses a private API key from [www.themoviedb.org](www.themoviedb.org). It's stored in a class named Constants.java in the root code folder. And it should look like this:

```java
package com.gmail.at.boban.talevski.popularmovies;

public class Constants {

    public static final String API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE;
}
```
